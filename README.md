# ðŸš¦ YOLOv8s Traffic Detection Model

This YOLOv8s model is trained on a custom traffic dataset to detect five key object classes:  
**bicycle, bus, car, motorbike, and person**.

It is optimized for **real-time detection in urban environments**, and can be used in applications such as:
- ðŸš— Traffic monitoring
- ðŸŒ† Smart city infrastructure
- ðŸš™ Autonomous driving systems
